# Ladzik - remote controlled robot using web browser
<a>robot named "Ladzik" is really a raspberry pi on crawler platform. It has attached a raspberry pi camera v2 on front and a lipo battery mounted underneath a platform for vision and power. For a computer that drives everything I settled on raspberry pi zero w but you can use for example:</a> 
<ul>
<li>rasberry pi 4 - set in parallel with platform and in my case I used rubberbands to secure it</li>
<li>arduino - not tested but manufacturer of the platform shows arduino uno is supported and has a holes for it</li>
<li>any other microcontroller - I couldn't test it, I don't have any</li>
</ul>

<h2>PCA9685.py and main.py are based on/copied from code published on: <br> https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Motor_Driver_HAT in section "Demo".</h2>
<a>that code is for controlling HAT attachment on raspberry pi zero 2 w that drives motors of a robot.</a>
